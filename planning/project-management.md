## Overview
This document outlines the project management methodology, documentation standards, and collaboration processes for the Gainsly fitness app development project, ensuring clear communication, efficient execution, and high-quality deliverables.

## Project Management Methodology

### Agile Framework
- **Methodology**: Scrum with Kanban elements
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks

- **Team Structure**: Cross-functional teams (frontend, backend, design, QA)

### Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes backlog, defines requirements, accepts deliverables
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates ceremonies, removes impediments, coaches team
- **Development Team**: Designs, develops, tests, and delivers features
- **UX/UI Designer**: Creates user experience flows and interface designs
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures quality through testing and automation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages infrastructure and deployment pipelines

### Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning**: Bi-weekly, 2-4 hours
- **Daily Standup**: Daily, 15 minutes
- **Sprint Review**: Bi-weekly, 1-2 hours
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Bi-weekly, 1 hour
- **Backlog Refinement**: Weekly, 1 hour
- **Tech Sync**: Weekly, 1 hour

## Project Tracking

### Tools
- **Project Management**: JIRA
- **Documentation**: Confluence
- **Code Repository**: GitHub
- **Communication**: Slack
- **Design**: Figma
- **Knowledge Base**: Notion

### Workflow
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of features and tasks
- **To Do**: Items selected for current sprint
- **In Progress**: Work actively being done
- **Review**: Code review, design review, or QA
- **Done**: Completed and accepted work

### Issue Types
- **Epic**: Large body of work that can be broken down
- **Story**: Functional slice of product from user perspective
- **Task**: Technical work item
- **Bug**: Defect requiring correction
- **Spike**: Research or investigation

### Story Points & Estimation
- Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Relative complexity, not time-based
- Planning poker for team estimation
- Velocity tracking for predictability

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- **Inline Comments**: Explain "why" not "what"
- **JSDoc/TSDoc**: For functions, classes, and interfaces
- **README Files**: Setup, usage, and contribution guidelines
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant decisions
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for all endpoints

### User Documentation
- **User Guides**: Step-by-step instructions
- **FAQ**: Common questions and answers
- **Tutorial Videos**: Visual demonstrations
- **In-App Help**: Contextual assistance

### Technical Documentation
- **System Architecture**: High-level design documents
- **Component Design**: Detailed component specifications
- **Database Schema**: Entity relationships and data models
- **Integration Points**: External system interfaces
- **Security Documentation**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

### Documentation Templates
- **Feature Specification Template**
- **Technical Design Document Template**
- **Test Plan Template**
- **Release Notes Template**
- **Post-Mortem Template**

## Requirements Management

### User Story Format
```
As a [type of user],
I want [goal],
So that [benefit].

Acceptance Criteria:
1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]

Technical Notes:
- [Note 1]
- [Note 2]
```

### Definition of Ready
- Story is clear, concise, and valuable
- Acceptance criteria are defined
- Dependencies are identified
- Design assets are available
- Story is sized by the team
- Technical approach is understood

### Definition of Done
- Code meets standards and passes review
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- Feature is deployed to staging
- Acceptance criteria are met
- Product Owner has accepted

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user flows
- **Performance Testing**: System under load
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment

### QA Process
- Test planning during sprint planning
- Test case development alongside development
- Daily testing of completed features
- Regression testing before releases
- Automated test suite execution in CI/CD

### Bug Management
- Severity classification (Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial)
- Priority assignment (High, Medium, Low)
- Reproduction steps documentation
- Expected vs. actual results
- Screenshots or videos when applicable

## Release Management

### Release Planning
- Release roadmap with themes and milestones
- Feature prioritization based on business value
- Risk assessment for each release
- Capacity planning based on team velocity

### Release Process
1. Feature freeze
2. Regression testing
3. Release candidate creation
4. Staging environment validation
5. Release notes preparation
6. Production deployment
7. Post-deployment verification
8. Announcement to stakeholders

### Versioning
- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR: Backward-compatible functionality
- PATCH: Backward-compatible bug fixes

## Risk Management

### Risk Identification
- Technical risks
- Schedule risks
- Resource risks
- External dependency risks
- Security risks

### Risk Assessment
- Impact evaluation (High, Medium, Low)
- Probability evaluation (High, Medium, Low)
- Risk score calculation (Impact × Probability)

### Risk Mitigation
- Preventive actions
- Contingency plans
- Risk owners assignment
- Regular risk review

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Daily standups for team coordination
- Weekly status reports for stakeholders
- Monthly demos for broader organization
- Slack channels for real-time communication
- Documentation in Confluence for knowledge sharing

### External Communication
- Release announcements for users
- Feedback collection mechanisms
- Support channels monitoring
