# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility standards, best practices, and implementation guidelines for the Gainsly fitness application to ensure an inclusive experience for users of all abilities, in compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Accessibility Standards

### Compliance Goals
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance
- Section 508 compliance (for potential government/enterprise clients)
- EN 301 549 compliance (European standard)

### Key Principles
1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

## Visual Design Accessibility

### Color and Contrast
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
- Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)
- Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for UI components and graphical objects
- Color must not be the only means of conveying information
- Provide alternative visual indicators (icons, patterns, etc.)

### Typography
- Use readable font families (sans-serif recommended for UI)
- Minimum text size of 16px for body text
- Maintain proper line height (1.5 times the font size)
- Ensure adequate letter spacing
- Support text resizing up to 200% without loss of content or functionality

### Layout and Spacing
- Consistent navigation and layout
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (minimum 8px)
- Touch targets minimum size of 44×44 pixels
- Responsive design that adapts to different viewport sizes
- Content reflow for zoomed interfaces

### Focus Indicators
- Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Focus indicator contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors
- Focus indicators that outline the entire component
- No loss of focus indicator during keyboard navigation

## Content Accessibility

### Text Alternatives
- Alt text for all images
- Descriptive alt text that conveys the purpose and content
- Empty alt attributes for decorative images
- Text alternatives for complex visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Captions and transcripts for video content
- Text descriptions for icons and visual indicators

### Headings and Structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- No skipped heading levels
- Semantic HTML elements (article, section, nav, etc.)
- Logical reading order
- Proper list markup for lists
- Table headers for data tables

### Links and Navigation
- Descriptive link text (avoid "click here" or "read more")
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Skip navigation links
- Breadcrumb trails for complex navigation
- Current location indicators

### Forms and Inputs
- Associated labels for all form controls
- Error identification and suggestions
- Error prevention for important submissions
- Clear instructions and placeholder text
- Grouped related form elements with fieldsets and legends

## Interaction Accessibility

### Keyboard Accessibility
